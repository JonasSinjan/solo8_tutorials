    "The Radio and Plasma Waves instrument (RPW) has to consist of a sophisticated plasma/radio wave receiver system connected to high sensitivity electric and magnetic sensors. Since the receiver system covers a very wide frequency range (quasi-DC to 20 MHz for electric, and 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz for magnetic), different kinds of sensors are used for the measurements. </font>\n",

    "\n",
    "List of RPW data products can be found in https://confluence-lesia.obspm.fr/display/ROC/RPW+Data+Products.\n",
    "Each RPW data product has a filename convention of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<Source_name>_<Level>_<Descriptor>_<Datetime>_V<Data_version>.<extension>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* `Source_name` is always `solo`\n",
    "* `Level` is the data processing level. It can be `{L0,L1,L2,L3}`.\n",
    "* `Descriptor` for each data product is lower case and starts with the prefix `rpw-<receiver>-<mode>` with `receiver` can be `lfr`, `tds`, `tnr`, `hfr` or `bia` and `mode` indicates the software mode (`surv` for normal/burst survey modes, `sbm1` or `sbm2` for SBM1 or SBM2 mode respectively. Optional suffixes - separated by minus hyphens - can be appended to the descriptor to specify the type of data (e.g., `cwf-e` for electrical continuous snapshot waveform).\n",
    "* `Datetime` is the date/time of the file. For RPW it can be a date (for daily files) or a time range (for SBM event files).\n",
    "* `Data_version` is the 2-digits version of the data file. It is incremented by one everytime a new version of a given file is released.\n",
    "* `extension` is `cdf` for all CDF format files (L1, L2, L3). `h5` for HDF5 format file (L0). `png` for PNG images (L3 summary plots only).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: Each filename field can be retrieved from the CDF file's global attributes.\n",
    "\n",
