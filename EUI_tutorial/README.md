# EUI tutorial

The EUI tutorial is spread out over (currently) four different Jupyter Notebooks, and it's highly suggested to start with the notebook labeled 1_introduction. The notebooks are not stand-alone, but make use of an EUI dataset that can be downloaded as a separate zip file from the ROB cloud system [here](https://cloud-as.oma.be/index.php/s/jzZ5qHPqzb8zMrN). This zip file should be extracted next to the Jupyter Notebooks, creating several 'data_' directories next to the ipynb notebook files.
