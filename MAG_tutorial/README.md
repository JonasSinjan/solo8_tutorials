# [MAG tutorial](tutorial)

This Data Analysis Tutorial for MAG will guide you though getting hold of MAG
data from the ESA Solar Orbiter Archive (SOAR) and using that data. We will
describe the different types of MAG data products that are available on the
SOAR, and what data each of the products contain. We will also provide several
examples of how you can use MAG data products.

## User Guide

In this notebook you will be guided through downloading MAG data using the
Web API provided by the SOAR and also downloading MAG data using SunPy.

### `analysis.ipynb`

SPICE data to calculate the Parker Spiral angle from MAG data.

### `metadata.ipynb`
